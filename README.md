# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-on-Online-Retail-Dataset

This project involves customer segmentation using machine learning models: K-Means, Mini Batch K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. The objective is to cluster customers based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) values utilizing the Online Retail dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The process includes extensive data preprocessing and outlier detection, followed by model evaluation using the Silhouette score and the Elbow method. The goal is to determine the most effective clustering technique for identifying groups of customers with similar purchasing behaviors. The insights from this analysis will assist businesses in refining marketing strategies and enhancing customer relationship management (CRM).

The dataset, 'Online Retail' from UCI Machine Learning Repository, is downloaded and converted to .xlsx format. For secure and scalable management, it is uploaded to AWS S3, which ensures redundancy and access control via AWS IAM. The dataset is accessed and processed using Google Colab, integrated with AWS S3 for real-time data consistency.

This project utilizes a structured approach similar to the CRISP-DM methodology for consumer segmentation. This framework, with its six stages and sub-tasks, ensures a systematic progression from concept to deployment. It helps in accurately estimating time and effort, providing a clear path for tackling consumer segmentation. This modified approach aims to deliver actionable insights that significantly impact marketing strategies and customer engagement.

Understanding customer behavior and preferences is crucial for business success and growth. Customer Segmentation Analysis helps in dividing the customer base into distinct groups based on common traits or behaviors. This project aims to develop machine learning models to cluster customers using various criteria, seeking significant patterns to inform strategic decisions.

By analyzing demographic data and employing unsupervised learning methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Clustering, and K-Means, we will identify key features that differentiate customer segments. The project will use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and evaluate their quality using the silhouette coefficient.

The goal is to provide actionable insights that enable businesses to tailor marketing strategies, product development, and service offerings to better meet customer needs. This targeted approach is expected to enhance customer engagement, improve satisfaction, and drive business growth by making strategic use of marketing resources.
