# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-on-Online-Retail-Dataset

This project involves customer segmentation using machine learning models: K-Means, Mini Batch K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. The objective is to cluster customers based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) values utilizing the Online Retail dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The process includes extensive data preprocessing and outlier detection, followed by model evaluation using the Silhouette score and the Elbow method. The goal is to determine the most effective clustering technique for identifying groups of customers with similar purchasing behaviors. The insights from this analysis will assist businesses in refining marketing strategies and enhancing customer relationship management (CRM).
